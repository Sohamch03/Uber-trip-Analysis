🚖 Uber Data Analysis Project – End-to-End with Python

📊 Uncovering Insights from Ride Data with Python

🔍 Project Overview
In this project, you’ll step into the role of a Data Analyst at Uber, tasked with solving real business problems using ride data. From understanding why users book rides to identifying when and how frequently they book, this project covers it all.

You'll use Python for cleaning, processing, analyzing, and visualizing the data. It's an ideal project for data enthusiasts aiming to enhance their skills in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and storytelling with data.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
Python 3.8+
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
CSV Dataset (Uber Ride Data)

🧩 Project Workflow
✅ Step 1: Environment Setup
Set up a clean Python workspace in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code. Organize folders: data/, notebooks/, insights/.

✅ Step 2: Dataset Loading
Source: Uber Ride Data from Kaggle or CSV file.

Load the data into a DataFrame using pandas.

✅ Step 3: Data Exploration
View structure: df.info(), df.head(), df.describe()

Check missing values and data types.

Analyze columns like category, purpose, start_date, miles.
✅ Step 5: Data Cleaning
🧹 Remove duplicates

🚫 Handle missing values smartly

🧮 Fix data types (convert dates, distances)

💲 Format values as needed

✅ Step 6: Feature Engineering
Extract hour, weekday, and month from timestamps

Calculate ride metrics (e.g., miles, trip duration)

Categorize ride purpose and frequency

📌 Business Questions Answered
Which category has the most Uber bookings?

What purpose drives most Uber rides?

At what time are most Uber cabs booked?

Which months see lower Uber activity?

Which days see the highest number of bookings?

How many miles do users typically travel?

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Use seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly for stunning visualizations:

📊 Count plots & bar graphs for categories and days

🕒 Time series plots for hourly & monthly trends

📍 Pie charts for purpose distribution

📐 Histograms for ride distances

🧠 Insights & Recommendations
Ride Category: Majority of users book business rides.

Purpose: Airport and meeting rides dominate.

Time: Peak hours are early morning and evening.

Days: Monday and Friday see the most activity.

Distance: Most rides fall within the 5–10 mile range.

Months: Bookings dip in July and December.

💡 Recommendation: Launch promotions in low-frequency months and optimize driver availability during peak hours.
