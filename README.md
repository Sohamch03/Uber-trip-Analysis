Uber Data Analysis Project: End-to-End Python Project
Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive data analysis solution designed to uncover key business insights from Uber ride data. Using Python for data processing and visualization, the project answers critical questions related to customer behavior, ride categories, and booking patterns. It is tailored for aspiring data analysts looking to improve skills in data wrangling, EDA, and business-driven insight generation.

Project Steps
1. Set Up the Environment
Tools Used: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code, Python
Goal: Prepare a well-structured environment for data analysis and visualization.

2. Load Dataset
Source: Uber ride dataset (CSV or Kaggle source)
Storage: Save the dataset in a data/ folder for easy reference.
Goal: Ensure the data is accessible for processing.
3. Install Required Libraries
Use the following command to install essential libraries:
-pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
-pip install datetime plotly
4. Explore the Data
Goal: Understand data columns, types, and distributions.
Tools:

.head(), .info(), .describe()

Visual inspection of null values and data types

5. Data Cleaning
Remove Duplicates: Avoid inflated counts due to repeated rows.

Handle Missing Values: Drop or impute missing values depending on significance.

Fix Data Types: Ensure datetime, float, and categorical columns are correctly formatted.

Validation: Perform sanity checks to ensure consistency post-cleaning.

6. Feature Engineering:
Create or extract relevant fields:

Extract hour, day of week, and month from timestamp

Categorize rides based on purpose, distance, or category

Derive features like trip duration, miles traveled, etc.

7. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Use plots and charts to answer key questions:

In which category do people book the most Uber rides?

For which purpose do people book Uber rides the most?

At what time do people book cabs the most from Uber?

In which months do people book Uber rides less frequently?

On which days of the week do people book Uber rides the most?

How many miles do people usually book a cab for through Uber?

Tools Used:

matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

Count plots, pie charts, bar plots, time-series plots

8. Insights and Interpretation
From the analysis:

Identify most used categories and purposes

Detect time-of-day and day-of-week booking trends

Understand seasonal trends in ride frequency

Calculate average ride distance

Requirements:
Python 3.8+
Python Libraries:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, datetime, plotly
Clean Uber ride dataset
